This project uses a card game as an evironment for a multi-agent system. The game is based off a card
game called "Get Bit!" and has the same rules. The framework of the game showcases both agents and a user 
(i.e. the player) influencing the same environment. It is also an opportunity to explore different strategies
for agents in a competitive environment.
